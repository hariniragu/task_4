Task 4 â€“ SQL for Data Analysis
This project demonstrates SQL skills for data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, joining tables, subqueries, views, and indexes using SQLite.

The provided task4_queries.sql file contains all queries with clear comments for each task requirement.

The database schema includes Customers, Products, and Orders tables with sample data for realistic practice.

Queries include basic SELECT statements, WHERE filters, and ORDER BY sorting.

Aggregate functions like SUM and AVG are used along with GROUP BY for grouped analysis.

Join queries (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) combine data across tables.

Subqueries identify specific records such as high-priced products and targeted customer purchases.

A view is created to store high-value orders, and an index is added for performance optimization.

Run the .sql file in sqliteonline.com or any SQLite-compatible tool and capture screenshots for submission
